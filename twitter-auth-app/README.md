# Twitter Firehose Web Application

### Configuration / Add environment variables

Type in your twitter-app credentials and your domain-name in `server/.npmrc` and in `client/src/config.js`. (See `.npmrc.example` and `client/src/config.js.example`)

### Start production build (docker)

Just type `make run-build-production` for a complete build and afterwards type `make run-production` to start the container.

### Start development

Start server and client separately with `make` in `/client` and `/server` or follow our recommendation and use `make run-development -j2` (type at top level of your project).

### Open WebApp

The frontend runs on [http://127.0.0.1:3001](http://127.0.0.1:3001), the backend which includes a reverse proxy on [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/).
